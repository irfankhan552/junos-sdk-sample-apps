    <p>Using this site you may authorize or repudiate your own access. Until
    you are authorized, all of your traffic will come back here to the captive 
    portal. Once you have authorized yourself, you remain authroized so long as
    the captive portal daemon is running. You will also only be able to return 
    to this site manually, so you may want to bookmark or remember it.</p>
    <p>When you have been authorized, access will be granted to your IP address,
    and you will be able to connect to locations outside of the captive portal.
    You will also be able to repudiate your access.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="center">Validate actions are:
      <a href="/check.html">Check status</a> | 
      <a href="/authorize.html">Authorize</a> | 
      <a href="/repudiate.html">Repudiate</a>
    </p>
    <p><em><u>Note:</u></em> Choosing to repudiate access when you do not have
    it, or to authorize access when you do have it, does nothing.</p>
